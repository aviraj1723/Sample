                    <strong>Hashirama Senju</strong> was a legendary shinobi. He lived during the Warring States Period, ehich was marked by constant warfare between the ninja clans. Hashirama was the first Hokage and co-founder of the Hidden Leaf Village alongside his friend <a href="Madara.html">Madara Uchiha.</a> Here are some keypoints about 1st Lord Hokage:
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li><strong>Senju Clan:</strong> Hashirama was born into the Senju Clan, one of the two most powerful clans during his time, the other being the<a href="Uchiha.html"> Uchiha Clan.</a></li>
                        <li><strong>Wood Release:</strong> He possessed a unique "Kekkei Genkai" called Wood Release (Mokuton), which allowed him to control plants and create wood-based jutsu. He could even create colossal wooden constructs like the "Wooden Buddha" statue. It was believed by the villagers and other shinobis that only Hashirama could use Wood-style, but later few other characters were introduced in the manga who could use Wood Release:
                        <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                            <li><i><strong>Yamato(Tenzo):</strong></i> Yamato is a shinobi who served under the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade. He was one of the test subjects for Orochimaru's experiments to replicate Hashirama's Wood Style. Orochimaru injected Yamato with Hashirama's cells, granting him the ability to use Wood Style.</li>
                            <li><i><strong>Madara Uchiha:</strong></i> Later in the series, it was revealed that Madara Uchiha, the co-founder of Konohagakure and Hashirama's rival, also gained the ability to use Wood Style. He obtained this power by integrating Hashirama's cells into his body, effectively making him a hybrid of Uchiha and Senju abilities.</li>
                            <li><i><strong>White Zetsu:</strong></i> The White Zetsu were artificial beings created by Kaguya Otsutsuki using the God Tree's power. They could use Wood Style, as they were essentially made from Hashirama's cells.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Founding of Konohagakure:</strong> After many battles and negotiations, Hashirama and Madara decided to put an end to the fighting and establish a village where people from different clans could live together in peace. Thus, they founded Konohagakure, with Hashirama becoming its First Hokage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Will of Fire:</strong> Hashirama had a strong sense of responsibility and cared deeply for his village and its inhabitants. He believed in the "Will of Fire," a philosophy that embodies the desire to protect and preserve the village and its future generations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legacy:</strong> Hashirama's influence continued even after his death, as his descendants, such as Tsunade and Nawaki, carried on his legacy. The Hidden Leaf Village also prospered under the foundations he laid.</li>
                        <li><strong>Edo Tensei:</strong> In the "Naruto" series, Hashirama was reincarnated using the Edo Tensei jutsu, a technique that brought back deceased ninja as immortal, controlled puppets.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>Hashirama became the leader of the Senju Clan at a young age, inheriting his father's position after his passing. Under his leadership, the Senju Clan became one of the most prominent and influential clans in the shinobi world. One of the defining aspects of Hashirama's character was his relationship with Madara Uchiha. They first met during a battle in the Valley of the End and quickly became friends, despite their opposing viewpoints on how to achieve peace. Their friendship eventually led to the founding of Konohagakure, but their differing visions for the village's future resulted in numerous conflicts. Together with Madara, Hashirama co-founded the Hidden Leaf Village (Konohagakure) with the goal of establishing peace between the clans and creating a unified community. After Madara's departure, Hashirama assumed the role of the First Hokage, the village's leader.<br>
                    Hashirama was an immensely powerful shinobi, renowned for his exceptional combat abilities and chakra control. His Wood Style techniques, combined with his mastery of other elemental jutsu, made him a formidable opponent. He was often considered one of the most potent shinobi in history.<br>
                    Hashirama was known for his optimistic and compassionate nature. He deeply cared for his friends, family, and the well-being of the shinobi world. His willingness to sacrifice for peace and his sense of duty as Hokage earned him respect from both allies and adversaries alike.
                    <br>Throughout the series, Hashirama's impact on the shinobi world and his dynamic with other characters, especially Madara Uchiha, play a significant role in shaping the narrative. His character showcases leadership, strength, and a deep desire for peace, making him one of the most revered figures in the "Naruto" universe. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Hashirama was reincarnated by Kabuto Yakushi using the Edo Tensei jutsu to fight on the side of the Allied Shinobi Forces. Hashirama's reputation as a legendary shinobi and his unparalleled skills led to him being hailed as the "God of Shinobi" during his time.<br>
